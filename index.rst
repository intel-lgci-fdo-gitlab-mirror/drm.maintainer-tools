DRM Maintainer Tools
====================

This documentation covers the tools and workflows for maintaining and
contributing to the Linux kernel DRM subsystem's drm-misc, drm-intel
and drm-xe repositories. The intended audience is primarily the
maintainers and committers of said repositories, but the workflow
documentation may be useful for anyone interested in the kernel
graphics subsystem development.

The drm-misc, drm-intel and drm-xe repos are maintained using the same
tools and very similar workflows. All feed to the same testing and
integration tree, the drm-tip. The documentation here is mostly
shared, highlighting the differences in workflows where applicable.

Please see :ref:`contributing` as well as the `project home page`_ for more
information on how to collaborate on the documentation and tools.
